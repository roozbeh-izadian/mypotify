<h2>Synopsis</h2>

Born on April 25, 1940 in New York City, Alfredo James Pacino began 
studying acting at 19. He brought brooding seriousness and explosive 
rage to gritty roles, including that of Michael Corleone in 
The Godfather (1972) and an incorruptible cop in Serpico (1973).

<h2>Early Life</h2>

Alfredo James Pacino was born in New York City on April 25, 1940. 
Growing up in East Harlem and the Bronx, Pacino moved to Greenwich 
Village at the age of 19 to pursue acting. There, on Bank Street, he 
began studying the art form at the Herbert Berghof Studio, and soon 
began landing parts in theatre productions, including Out There in 1963.
 Several years later, in 1969, Pacino performed in the Broadway play 
Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?—for which he received a Tony Award—as
 well as Me, Natalie, a coming-of-age film about a young woman living 
in New York City.

<h2>Acting Career</h2>

Pacino was cast as Bobby in the film The Panic in Needle Park, which 
was released in 1971, and met with little fame until several years later. 
The film noir details the lives of several heroin addicts who congregate 
in New York City's "Needle Park." Following this performance, Pacino 
significantly advanced his career in the early 1970s, when he met and 
began working with director Francis Ford Coppola.

Pacino starred as Michael in The Godfather, an American gangster film
 that was released in 1972. The film received wide critical acclaim, 
winning three Academy Awards. The performance propelled Pacino
 into Hollywood stardom. The following year, in 1973, he starred as the 
character Francis Lionel "Lion" Delbuchi in Scarecrow, a film about the 
endearing partnership of an ex-con and a homeless man; and as Frank 
Serpico in Serpico, a film about real-life New York police officer who 
was betrayed by his fellow officers when he uncovered illegaly activity 
within the department.

In 1974, Pacino reunited with Coppola for the second part of the 
Godfather series, the Academy Award-winning The Godfather: Part II, 
again playing Michael. A year later, he hit the big screen again, with 
Dog Day Afternoon, the story of a bank robbery that escalates into a 
hostage situation. Pacino plays Sonny Wortzik in the film.

In 1990, Pacino came back for the third and final Godfather series film, 
The Godfather, Part III. That same year, he was nominated for an Oscar 
for Best Supporting Actor, for his role in Dick Tracy. The '90s proved to 
be a strong decade for Pacino, as he worked continously on big films, 
including Frankie and Johnny (1991); Glengarry Glen Ross (1992); Scent 
of a Woman (1992); Carlito's Way (1993); Heat (1995); 
Donnie Brasco (1997); The Devil's Advocate (1997); and 
Any Given Sunday (1999). 

At the turn of the century, Pacino turned 60. Despite having dozens of 
film appearances under his belt by that time, his career didn't slow 
down. In 2002, he starred as a homicide detective alongside Robin 
Williams in Insomnia, a film about a young woman's mysterious 
murder; as well as in People I Know, in which he plays press agent Eli 
Wurman. Five years later, in 2007, he played a part in the blockbuster 
hit Ocean's Thirteen.

More recently, Pacino received public and critical acclaim—including 
an Emmy Award and Golden Globe—for his role as Dr. Jack Kevorkian, 
an assisted-suicide advocate, in the 2010 TV movie You Don’t Know Jack.

<h2>Producer and Director</h2>

Outside of acting, Pacino has received applause for his work as a 
director. In 1996, he directed and produced Looking for Richard, a 
documentary about William Shakespeare and one of Shakespeare's 
known plays, Richard III. In 2000, Pacino directed and performed in 
the film Chinese Coffee, nearly a decade after playing a part in the 
original, Broadway version. More than a decade later, in 2011, he
directed a film about writer Oscar Wilde, Wilde Salome. Pacino has 
worked solely as a producer on other films, as well.
