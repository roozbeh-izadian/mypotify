<h2>Synopsis</h2>

Marlon Brando was born April 3, 1924, in Omaha,
Nebraska. After early promise in the 1940s and
'50s, including a legendary performance in the
film version of A Streetcar Named Desire, 
Brando's film career had more downs than up 
until his starring role in The Godfather. Later
, he received huge salaries for small parts. He
became known for self-indulgence but was always
respected for his finest work.

<h2>Early Broadway Roles</h2>

Actor Marlon Brando was born on April 3, 1924, in 
Omaha, Nebraska. Brando grew up in Illinois, and 
after expulsion from a military academy, he dug 
ditches until his father offered to finance his 
education. Brando moved to New York to study with 
acting coach Stella Adler and at Lee Strasberg's 
Actors' Studio. Adler has often been credited as 
the principal inspiration in Brando's early career, 
and with opening the actor to great works of 
literature, music and theater.

While at the Actors' Studio, Brando adopted the 
"method approach," which emphasizes characters' 
motivations for actions. He made his Broadway 
debut in John Van Druten's sentimental I Remember 
Mama (1944). New York theater critics voted him 
Broadway's Most Promising Actor for his performance 
in Truckline Caf (1946). In 1947, he played his 
greatest stage role, Stanley Kowalski -- the brute 
who rapes his sister-in-law, the fragile Blanche du 
Bois in Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire.

<h2>Hollywood Bad Boy</h2>

Hollywood beckoned to Brando, and he made his motion
picture debut as a paraplegic World War II veteran 
in The Men (1950). Although he did not cooperate 
with the Hollywood publicity machine, he went on to 
play Kowalski in the 1951 film version of A 
Streetcar Named Desire, a popular and critical 
success that earned four Academy Awards.

Brando's next movie, Viva Zapata! (1952), with a 
script by John Steinbeck, traces Emiliano Zapata's 
rise from peasant to revolutionary. Brando followed 
that with Julius Caesar and then The Wild One (1954)
,in which he played a motorcycle-gang leader in all
his leather-jacketed glory. Next came his Academy 
Award-winning role as a longshoreman fighting the 
system in On the Waterfront, a hard-hitting look at 
New York City labor unions.

During the rest of the decade, Brando's screen roles
ranged from Napoleon Bonaparte in Désirée (1954), 
to Sky Masterson in 1955's Guys and Dolls, in which 
he sang and danced, to a Nazi soldier in The Young 
Lions (1958). From 1955 to 1958, movie exhibitors 
voted him one of the top 10 box-office draws in the 
nation.

During the 1960s, however, his career had more downs
than ups, especially after the MGM studio's 
disastrous 1962 remake of Mutiny on the Bounty, 
which failed to recoup even half of its enormous 
budget. Brando portrayed Fletcher Christian, Clark 
Gable's role in the 1935 original. Brando's 
excessive self-indulgence reached a pinnacle during
the filming of this movie. He was criticized for his
on-set tantrums and for trying to alter the script. 
Off the set, he had numerous affairs, ate too much, 
and distanced himself from the cast and crew. His 
contract for making the movie included $5,000 for 
every day the film went over its original schedule. 
He made $1.25 million when all was said and done.

<h2>'The Godfather'</h2>

Brando's career was reborn in 1972 with his 
depiction of Mafia chieftain Don Corleone in Francis 
Ford Coppola's The Godfather, a role for which he 
received the Academy Award for Best Actor. He turned 
down the Oscar, however, in protest of Hollywood's 
treatment of Native Americans. Brando himself did 
not appear at the awards show. Instead, he sent a 
Native American Apache named Sacheen Littlefeather 
(who was later determined to be an actress 
portraying a Native American) to decline the award 
on his behalf.

<h2>Later Roles</h2>

Brando proceeded the following year to the highly 
controversial yet highly acclaimed Last Tango in 
Paris, which was rated X. Since then, Brando has 
received huge salaries for playing small parts in 
such movies as Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now 
(1979). Nominated for an Academy Award for Best 
Supporting Actor for A Dry White Season in 1989, 
Brando also appeared in the comedy The Freshman with 
Matthew Broderick.

In 1995, Brando costarred in Don Juan DeMarco with 
Johnny Depp. In early 1996, Brando costarred in the 
poorly received The Island of Dr. Moreau. 
Entertainment Weekly reported that the actor was 
using an earpiece to remember his lines. His costar 
in the film, David Thewlis, told the magazine that 
Brando nonetheless impressed him. "When he walks 
into a room," Thewlis noted, "you know he's around."

In 2001, Brando starred as an aging jewel thief in 
pursuit of one last payoff in The Score, also 
starring Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, and Angela 
Bassett.

<h2>Personal Life</h2>

It has been observed that Brando has perhaps loved 
food and womanizing too much. His best acting 
performances are roles that required him to show a 
constrained and displayed rage and suffering. His 
own rage may have come from parents who did not care 
about him.

Time magazine reported, "Brando had a stern, cold 
father and a dream-disheveled mother- both 
alcoholics, both sexually promiscuous-and he 
encompassed both their natures without resolving the 
conflict." Brando himself wrote in his autobiography, 
"If my father were alive today, I don't know what I 
would do. After he died, I used to think, 'God, just 
give him to me alive for eight seconds because I 
want to break his jaw.'"

Although Brando avoids speaking in detail about his 
marriages, even in his autobiography, it is known 
that he has been married three times to three 
ex-actresses. He has at least 11 children. Five of 
the children are with his three wives, three are 
with his Guatemalan housekeeper, and the other three 
children are from affairs. One of Brando's sons, 
Christian Brando, told People magazine, "The family 
kept changing shape. I'd sit down at the breakfast 
table and say, 'Who are you?'"

In 1991, Christian was convicted of voluntary 
manslaughter in the death of his sister's fiancee, 
Dag Drollet, and received a 10-year sentence. He 
claimed Drollet was physically abusing his pregnant 
sister, Cheyenne. Christian said he struggled with 
Drollet and accidentally shot him in the face. 
Brando, in the house at the time, gave 
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to Drollet and called 
911. At Christian's trial, People reported one of 
Brando's comments on the witness stand, "I tried to 
be a good father. I did the best I could."

Brando's daughter, Cheyenne, was a troubled young 
woman. In and out of drug rehabilitation centers and
mental hospitals for much of her life, she lived in 
Tahiti with her mother Tarita (one of Brando's wives, 
whom he met on the set of Mutiny on the Bounty). 
People reported in 1990 that Cheyenne said of Brando, 
"I have come to despise my father for the way he 
ignored me as a child."

After Drollet's death, Cheyenne became even more 
reclusive and depressed. A judge ruled that she was 
too depressed to raise her child and gave custody of 
the boy to her mother, Tarita. Cheyenne took a leave 
from a mental hospital on Easter Sunday in 1995 to 
visit her family. At her mother's home that day, 
Cheyenne, who had attempted suicide before, hanged 
herself.

<h2>Death and Legacy</h2>

Brando's years of self-indulgence are visible, as he 
weighed well over 300 pounds in the mid-1990s. The 
actor died of pulmonary fibrosis in a Los Angeles 
hospital in 2004 at the age of 80. But to judge 
Brando by his appearance and dismiss his work 
because of his later, less significant acting jobs, 
however, would be a mistake. His performance in A 
Streetcar Named Desire brought audiences to their 
knees, and his range of roles is a testament to his 
capability to explore many aspects of the human 
psyche.
